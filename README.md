# uni

A selection of algorithms, implemented during the courses at UNI-LJ and covering different topics:
- **Approximation and interpolation:** Remes method, orthonormal poly. base, poly. spline interpolation operators.
 - **Bioinformatics:** Learning of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).
 - **Computational geometry:** Solving the *ghosts vs busters* problem via the ham-sandwich cut.
 - **Computer-aided geometric design:** Methods focusing on the construction of Bezier curves.
 - **Linear programming:** The simplex method.
 - **Numerical integration and solving ODEs:** Methods for numerical integration and solving of ordinary differential equations.
 - **Randomised and approximation algorithms:** Satisfiability (SAT), subset sum and min-cut solving.
 - **Systems biology:** An overview of the problem of model integration.
 - **Topological data analysis:** Vietoris-Rips complex construction.

Certain problems have their own `readme` files for better illustration.

#### Note

Most implementations are coded in `python`, while a few are either in `Rust` or `matlab`. The code is commented somewhat inconsistently and is unlikely to be updated, but might be helpful nonetheless (free to use in any capacity).
